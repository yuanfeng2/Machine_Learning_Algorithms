# Machine Learning Algorithms

## content

For the purpose of better undestanding Machine Learning algorithms, I implementated a series of popular machine learning algorithms in Python and its corresponding mathematical justification by hand. Each notebook contains several implementations and related example to illustrate the use case in real-world problems.
